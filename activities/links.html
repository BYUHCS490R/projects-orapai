        <h2>Link to an outside website with an absolute link.</h2>
        <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/welcome/life-has-purpose?lang=eng">Meaning in Your Life</a>
        <!-- absolute link, protocol/domain/path  -->

        <h2>What is the root? What is the relationship between folder and file names and the path?</h2>
        <p>The root is the starting point of a website. The path shows how to get from the root through folders to a specific file, so folders and file names create the steps in that “address.”</p>

        <h2>What is a default document?</h2>
        <p>A default document is the page that automatically loads when a user visits a website, often called index.html. This helps websites open a starting page without the visitor needing to type the file name.</p>

        <h2>Explain the difference between an absolute link and a relative link. Why would you use relative links?</h2>
        <p>An absolute link uses the entire URL including domain, while a relative link points to a file based on the current folders location. Relative links are helpful when working on the same website because they make it easier to move files without breaking the links.</p>

        <h2>Link to another engagement assignment (something in the activity folder).</h2>
        <a href="htmltags.html">HTML Tags</a> 
        <!-- relative link, filename only -->

        <h2>List the 3 rules with relative links.</h2>
        <p>First, if the file is in the same folder, just use the filename. Second, if the file is in a subfolder, include the folder name and a slash before the filename. Third, if the file is in a higher-level folder, use ../ to go up a level.</p>

        <h2>Link to your last project.</h2>
        <a href="../projects/structural.html">Structural page</a>. 
        <!-- This takes the user directly to the project file. -->
        <!-- .. to go out of the folder(in your inside the folder), ../Up and then down a folder, / start over(doesnt work for us) -->
        <h2>Do links always need to be inside a NAV tag?</h2>
        <p>No, links do not always have to be inside a NAV tag. The NAV tag is best for main navigation menus, but links can also go in the footer, main content, or even inside a paragraph if they connect to useful resources.</p>
