                    <h3>Fa Li</h3>
                    <p>Fa Li is a supporting character in Disney's 1998 animated feature film Mulan. She is the wife of Fa Zhou and the mother of Fa Mulan. Like her husband, she seems to be very traditional. She cares deeply about Mulan and her safety, as shown by her reaction when learning that Mulan has run away to join the army. Fa Li is notable, in that she is one of the few mothers of a Disney heroine to be still alive during the film, rather than deceased.</p>
