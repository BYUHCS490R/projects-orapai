    <h1>Aloha! Welcome to my profile page.</h1>
    <p>My name is Ivy Orapa, and I'm from Cebu, Philippines. I have three siblings: my elder brother, my twin sister, and my younger sister. I am an hour older than my twin sister, and we're the only ones who've served a mission in our siblings.</p>

    <p>I am an introvert and an extrovert person depending on my mood and the people around me. But most of the time, I tend to be more introvert especially that I love to just sit in a corner and oberve the things and the people around me. I like to learn new skills and I'm interested in learning a new language from Asia such as:</p>
    <ol type="1">
        <li>Japanese</li>
        <li>Korean</li>
        <li>Chinese</li>
        <li>Thai</li>
    </ol>
    <p>My favorite Japanese proverb is:</p>
    <blockquote> <em>七転び八起き</em> </blockquote>
    <p>which reads <mark>"Nanakorobi yaoki"</mark> and translates as "Fall seven times, stand up eight". This means that no matter how many times we fail, never give up.</p>
    <p> <strong>Never giving up</strong> is always &gt; than the number of times we fall.</p>
