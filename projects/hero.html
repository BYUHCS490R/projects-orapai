        <h1>Favorite actor - <a href="https://m.leeminho.kr/us/main/html.php?htmid=proc/ABOUT%20HIM.html">Lee Min-Ho</a></h1>
        <p>Lee Min-Ho is a famous actor in Korea. He's become my favorite because he was the lead role of most of the Korean dramas that I've watched and found amusing. Some of the dramas I've watched are the following:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>City Hunter</li>
            <p>A 2011 South Korean television series based on the Japanese manga series of the same name written and illustrated by Tsukasa Hojo</p>
            <li>The Heirs</li>
            <p>The drama is set in a high school populated by the privileged and uber-rich.</p>
            <li>The Legend of the Blue Sea</li>
            <p>This drama tells the love story of a con-artist and a mermaid who travels across the ocean to find him.</p>
        </ol>
