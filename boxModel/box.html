        <h3>What is the difference between block tags and inline tags?</h3>
        <p>
            Block tags' normal flow by default is 100% while inline tags flow alongside other content within the same line.
        </p>
        <h3>What is the margin, border, and padding?</h3>
        <p>
            The margin, border, and padding are used to control the element's spacing and appearance. Margin is for how much space you want outside the border, border is for the thickness of the line of the border which goes around the padding, and padding is the transparent space surrounding the content.

        <h3>What are units of measurement you can use in CSS?</h3>
        <p>
            There are pixels, a fix layout, but the downside is it is not good for phones. Another one is percentages, a fluid layout, and it is easier to use. Another one is EM which converts percentages to decimal. EM is more relative.
        </p>
        <h3>When would you use a figure tag?</h3>
        <p>
            A figure tag is another block tag. It can't tell to display an image but you can sorround it with figure tag. It's used to make img in a block.
