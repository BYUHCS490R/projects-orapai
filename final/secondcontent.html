        <p>My interest in traveling to Spain started in one of the Korean drama that I've watched. There was a part of the series where they went to Spain where the "end of the world" is. And after watching that part of the series, I just have had this desire in my heart that I will go to Spain to explore.</p>

                    <h3>Cape Finisterre (Cabo Fisterra) in Galicia</h3>
                    <p>The "end of the world" in Spain refers to Cape Finisterre (Cabo Fisterra) in Galicia, historically considered the westernmost point of the Iberian Peninsula. The name comes from the Latin finis terrae, meaning "end of the earth". The site was significant in ancient and Roman times as a place where they believed the sun set into the sea, and today it is the final destination for many pilgrims completing the Camino de Santiago.</p>

Barcelona is a major cultural, economic, and financial centre in southwestern Europe,[9] as well as the main biotech hub in Spain.[10] As a leading world city, Barcelona's influence in global socio-economic affairs qualifies it for global city status</p>
