        <p>A <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=bucket+list">"bucket list"</a> is a list of experiences or achievements a person hopes to have or accomplish during their lifetime, essentially "before they kick the bucket" or die. The term gained mainstream popularity from the 2007 movie The Bucket List, starring Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman. These lists can include anything from personal and professional goals to travel and creative projects.</p>
        <p>There are so many things I want to do or achieve in this life and I want to share the top five of them.</p>
