            <!-- there should be no space in naming for the ID, you can use a dash to separate two words but not space. -->

            <!-- You can add or apply more names in a class but not id. Class is more powerful.-->

        <h2>List out the different ways to select an item.</h2>
        <p>By the tag name. You can also have a space and that's the descendant tag rule. By ID, by Class.</p>
        <h2>What is the difference between an ID and a Class?</h2>
        <p> An ID can only be used once and should have no space when naming it, you can use a dash to separate two words but not space. A class can be applied to many elements which makes it more powerful.</p>
        <h2>What is the difference between a SPAN tag and a DIV tag?</h2>
        <p>A span is an inline element, used for styling or grouping small pieces of text/content inside a line. A div is a block-level element, used to group larger sections or blocks of content.</p>
        <h2>What is the difference between a DIV tag and a HEADER, MAIN, or FOOTER?</h2>
        <p>Div is a generic block container, doesnt describe meaning by itself. HEADER, MAIN, FOOTER are semantic elements introduced in HTML5 that describe the purpose of the content (header of the page, main content, footer). They improve accessibility and SEO.</p>
        <h2>What are the different ways to select a color?</h2>
        <p>By name. By hexadecimal code. By RGB values. By HSL</p>
