        <h2>Learning a new language</h2>
        <h3>Korean</h3>
        <p>Since I was young, I have enjoyed watching Asian drama, and one of them is Korean. I found their language cute and interesting. From then on, I started learning new words and wanted to learn how to read, so I started learning their alphabet. Reading and writing became possible, but I didn't fully understand what I was reading and writing.</p>
        <h3>Japanese</h3>
        <p>I was not that interested in the Japanese language until I had to learn it. I was called to serve in Japan, so I began studying the language and learning its alphabet. I was surprised by how many characters I needed to learn to be able to read, and even now, I still don't know. I'm just glad there is technology that I can use to look up the readings and meanings of different kanji or Chinese characters.</p>
        <h3>About Links</h3>
